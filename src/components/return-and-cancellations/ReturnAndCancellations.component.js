                Seal your package securely and leave it for your USPS postal
                carrier, or take it to your nearest USPS post office. USPS

                take the package to your nearest UPS or FedEx store, depending
                on the return shipping label you have received (SmartPost is
                FedEx). Choose whichever option is most convenient for you!
